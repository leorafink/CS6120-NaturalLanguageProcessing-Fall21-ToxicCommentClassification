Project Description

We built a multi-headed model thatâ€™s capable of detecting different types of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. We have three different models to predict a probability of each type of toxicity for a specific comment. And all these trained models will help us filter out and eliminate toxic comments and get a more productive and respectful online discussion.
